    "text": "What are different ways you can contribute?\n\nAnswer questions\nYou can help others use and learn vetiver by answering questions on the RStudio community site, Stack Overflow, and Twitter. Many people asking for help with vetiver don’t know what a reproducible example or “reprex” is, or how to craft one. Acknowledging an individual’s problem, showing them how to build a reprex, and pointing them to helpful resources are all enormously beneficial, even if you don’t immediately solve their problem.\nRemember that while you might have seen a problem a hundred times before, it’s new to the person asking it. Be patient, polite, and empathetic.\n\n\nFile issues\nIf you’ve found a bug, first create a minimal reproducible example. Spend some time working to make it as minimal as possible; the more time you spend doing this, the easier it is to fix the bug. When your reprex is ready, file it on the GitHub repo of the appropriate package, either Python or R.\nThe vetiver team often focuses on one package at a time to reduce context switching and be more efficient. We may not address each issue right away, but we will use the reproducible example you create to understand your problem when it is time to focus on that package.\n\n\nContribute documentation\nDocumentation is a high priority for vetiver, and pull requests to correct or improve documentation are welcome.\n\n\nContribute code\nIf you are a more experienced R or Python programmer, you may have the inclination, interest, and ability to contribute directly to package development. Before you submit a pull request to vetiver, always file an issue and confirm the vetiver team agrees with your idea and is happy with your basic proposal.\nWe use the tidyverse style guide for R and the PEP 8 style guide for Python. Using a style guide keeps your new code and documentation matching the existing style, and makes the review process much smoother."

The template automates extracting some information from the model object, and provides structure for the model developer where automation is not possible.\nModel developers see a nudge to create a model card when they publish a model; we recommend that you create a model card when you deploy a model for the first time and refresh that model card as needed when new versions are deployed.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nlibrary(vetiver)\nlibrary(pins)\nmodel_board <- board_temp()\n\ncars_lm <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)\nv <- vetiver_model(cars_lm, \"cars_linear\")\nvetiver_pin_write(model_board, v)\n\nCreating new version '20220919T211923Z-2bb55'\nWriting to pin 'cars_linear'\n\nCreate a Model Card for your published model\n• Model Cards provide a framework for transparent, responsible reporting\n• Use the vetiver `.Rmd` template as a place to start\n\n\n(Learn more about silencing messages like this if desired.)\n\n\n\nimport vetiver\nimport pins\nfrom vetiver.data import mtcars\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nmodel_board = pins.board_temp(allow_pickle_read=True)\n\nmodel = LinearRegression().fit(mtcars, mtcars[\"mpg\"])\nv = vetiver.VetiverModel(model, model_name = \"cars_linear\", \n                 save_ptype = True, ptype_data = mtcars)\n\nvetiver.vetiver_pin_write(model_board, v)\n\nModel Cards provide a framework for transparent, responsible reporting. \n Use the vetiver `.qmd` Quarto template as a place to start, \n with vetiver.model_card()\nWriting pin:\nName: 'cars_linear'\nVersion: 20220919T211928Z-64c37\n\n\nTo silence this message,\nfrom vetiver.utils import modelcard_options\n\nmodelcard_options.quiet = True"

(Some information about the training data can be extracted from the model object itself.) Some (probably different) specific dataset is used to evaluate the model in the context of the model card, so also explain what the evaluation data is like.\nQuantitative analyses: Provide the results of evaluating the model using your chosen metrics and the evaluation data. Be sure to present both overall results (for the dataset as a whole) and disaggregated results, especially with any aspects (demographic, environmental, or other) in mind that have been identified as important for this model. You can use both tables and visualization to present these quantitative analyses.\nEthical considerations: Share ethical considerations and any possible solutions considered. Some specific aspects to note are any sensitive data used, impact on human life, possible risks and harms, and important use cases.\nCaveats & recommendations: As the model developer, you likely have the most domain knowledge of what the model can and cannot do.

Machine learning can break quietly; a model can continue returning predictions without error, even if it is performing poorly. Without monitoring for degradation, this silent failure can continue undiagnosed. The vetiver framework offers functions to fluently compute, store, and plot model metrics. These functions are particularly suited to monitoring your model using multiple performance metrics over time.\nWhen a model is deployed, new data comes in over time, even if time is not a feature for prediction. Even if your model does not explicitly use any dates, a measure of time like a date can affect your model performance."
