    "section": "How does vetiver compare to other MLOps tools?",
    "text": "How does vetiver compare to other MLOps tools?\n\n😌 vetiver is a focused framework for data practitioners\nThe vetiver framework does not aim to be an all-in-one solution for all parts of the MLOps life cycle. Instead, vetiver provides tooling to version, deploy, and monitor ML models. This focus allows vetiver to provide a better user experience and composability as organizations mature in their MLOps needs. Tools like MLFlow and managed cloud offerings like SageMaker and AzureML are designed to be comprehensive; this can be the right choice in some situations but comes with usability challenges and a steeper learning curve.\nThe vetiver framework is built to be used by practitioners like data scientists and data analysts, the people who develop models. We believe that the person who develops a model is the right person to operationalize that model. This is in contrast to MLFlow, which is most comfortable for a software engineering persona (rather than data analysis persona).\n\n\n🐍 vetiver supports both Python and R\nExisting tools for MLOps tasks overwhelmingly support Python only, or provide poor or incomplete support other languages like R. Even cloud offerings like SageMaker and AzureML have very few meaningful native options for practitioners that want flexibility in their ML choices, with the ability to use their model implementation of choice for a specific problem. Data science teams that use both R and Python are an important focus for Posit, and we aim to provide the best possible tools for these bilingual teams.\nThe design of vetiver can be extended in the future to other languages. The underlying technologies (REST APIs, binary storage, dashboards) are language agnostic and could be extended to, for example, Julia.\n\n\n🚀 vetiver is for getting started with MLOps\nIn terms of MLOps maturity, it is still early days for many organizations and practitioners. These folks need a tool that provides a fluent experience as they get started with their MLOps tasks and grow their institutional knowledge about model deployment and management. The vetiver framework is uniquely positioned for teams getting started with MLOps, in terms of our attention to user experience and focus on documentation.\nOther existing tools like BentoML are similar to vetiver in that they are focused solutions built for practitioners, but BentoML provides advanced functionality and is less appropriate for a team just getting started."

    "text": "What are different ways you can contribute?\n\nAnswer questions\nYou can help others use and learn vetiver by answering questions on the RStudio community site, Stack Overflow, and Twitter. Many people asking for help with vetiver don’t know what a reproducible example or “reprex” is, or how to craft one. Acknowledging an individual’s problem, showing them how to build a reprex, and pointing them to helpful resources are all enormously beneficial, even if you don’t immediately solve their problem.\nRemember that while you might have seen a problem a hundred times before, it’s new to the person asking it. Be patient, polite, and empathetic.\n\n\nFile issues\nIf you’ve found a bug, first create a minimal reproducible example. Spend some time working to make it as minimal as possible; the more time you spend doing this, the easier it is to fix the bug. When your reprex is ready, file it on the GitHub repo of the appropriate package, either Python or R.\nThe vetiver team often focuses on one package at a time to reduce context switching and be more efficient. We may not address each issue right away, but we will use the reproducible example you create to understand your problem when it is time to focus on that package.\n\n\nContribute documentation\nDocumentation is a high priority for vetiver, and pull requests to correct or improve documentation are welcome.\n\n\nContribute code\nIf you are a more experienced R or Python programmer, you may have the inclination, interest, and ability to contribute directly to package development. Before you submit a pull request to vetiver, always file an issue and confirm the vetiver team agrees with your idea and is happy with your basic proposal.\nWe use the tidyverse style guide for R and the PEP 8 style guide for Python. Using a style guide keeps your new code and documentation matching the existing style, and makes the review process much smoother."

    "text": "What is a “Model Card”?\nGood documentation helps us make sense of software, know when and how to use it, and understand its purpose. The same can be true of documentation or reporting for a deployed model, but it can be hard to know where to start. The paper “Model Cards for Model Reporting” (Mitchell et al. 2019) provides a suggested framework for organizing and presenting the essential facts about a deployed machine learning model. The vetiver package provides an R Markdown template for creating a “Model Card” for a published vetiver model. The template automates extracting some information from the model object, and provides structure for the model developer where automation is not possible.\nModel developers see a nudge to create a model card when they publish a model; we recommend that you create a model card when you deploy a model for the first time and refresh that model card as needed when new versions are deployed.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nlibrary(vetiver)\nlibrary(pins)\nmodel_board &lt;- board_temp()\n\ncars_lm &lt;- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)\nv &lt;- vetiver_model(cars_lm, \"cars_linear\")\nvetiver_pin_write(model_board, v)\n\nCreating new version '20230525T200116Z-9db11'\nWriting to pin 'cars_linear'\n\nCreate a Model Card for your published model\n• Model Cards provide a framework for transparent, responsible reporting\n• Use the vetiver `.Rmd` template as a place to start\n\n\n(Learn more about silencing messages like this if desired.)\n\n\n\nimport vetiver\nimport pins\nfrom vetiver.data import mtcars\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nmodel_board = pins.board_temp(allow_pickle_read=True)\n\nmodel = LinearRegression().fit(mtcars.drop(columns=\"mpg\"), mtcars[\"mpg\"])\nv = vetiver.VetiverModel(model, model_name = \"cars_linear\", \n                         prototype_data = mtcars.drop(columns=\"mpg\"))\n\nvetiver.vetiver_pin_write(model_board, v)\n\nModel Cards provide a framework for transparent, responsible reporting. \n Use the vetiver `.qmd` Quarto template as a place to start, \n with vetiver.model_card()\nWriting pin:\nName: 'cars_linear'\nVersion: 20230525T200121Z-dc1c1\n\n\nTo silence this message,\nfrom vetiver.utils import modelcard_options\n\nmodelcard_options.quiet = True"

(Some information about the training data can be extracted from the model object itself.) Some (probably different) specific dataset is used to evaluate the model in the context of the model card, so also explain what the evaluation data is like.\nQuantitative analyses: Provide the results of evaluating the model using your chosen metrics and the evaluation data. Be sure to present both overall results (for the dataset as a whole) and disaggregated results, especially with any aspects (demographic, environmental, or other) in mind that have been identified as important for this model. You can use both tables and visualization to present these quantitative analyses.\nEthical considerations: Share ethical considerations and any possible solutions considered. Some specific aspects to note are any sensitive data used, impact on human life, possible risks and harms, and important use cases.\nCaveats & recommendations: As the model developer, you likely have the most domain knowledge of what the model can and cannot do. This section is a good place to share any additional thoughts, perhaps including how your own identity may or may not come into play in the model’s context."

However, we strongly advise that instead of deleting any such section because you have incomplete or imprecise information, you note your own process and considerations. Also, consider the possibility of gathering feedback from those impacted by the machine learning system, especially those with marginalized identities.\nThe process of documenting the extent and limits of a machine learning system is part of transparent, responsible reporting. A model card framework such as this is a helpful tool and some parts of a model card can be automated, but ultimately the extent of its value depends on you. From Mitchell et al. (2019):\n\nTherefore the usefulness and accuracy of a model card relies on the integrity of the creator(s) of the card itself."

    "text": "Once a model is deployed, it is important to monitor its statistical performance. Machine learning can break quietly; a model can continue returning predictions without error, even if it is performing poorly. Often these quiet performance problems are discussed as types of model drift; data drift can occur when the statistical distribution of an input feature changes, or concept drift occurs when there is change in the relationship between the input features and the outcome.\nWithout monitoring for degradation, this silent failure can continue undiagnosed. The vetiver framework offers functions to fluently compute, store, and plot model metrics. These functions are particularly suited to monitoring your model using multiple performance metrics over time. Effective model monitoring is not “one size fits all”, but instead depends on choosing appropriate metrics and time aggregation for a given application."
